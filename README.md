# Centerpoint_resilient_diffusion
Comparison between non-cooperative, average, median, geometric median, and centerpoint based aggregation for adapt-then-combine (ATC) distributed diffusion.

## How to run
Run python3 main.py  
change attackerNum = 0 to simulate the case with no attack, and attackerNum = 6 to simulate the case with 6 Byzantine agents.
